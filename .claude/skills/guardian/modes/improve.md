# Mode: improve

Fix exactly one approved finding (by ID), by ladder position (`reference/enforcement.md`).

- **Mechanizable** → codify the enforcement (lint/type/schema/test/coverage gate), not just patch the instance; first check the rule/plugin is already available; if a new dep or hook/CI change is needed, stop and propose.
- **Not mechanizable** → smallest correct prose/spec change, or produce a `plan` if it needs architectural/product judgment.
- **basis-form migration** → migrate case→basis or collapse an empty axis under the visible-axis guardrail (`reference/basis-form.md`); then promote the syndrome to a check (`reference/enforcement.md`).

Rules: one finding only; small patch; add/update verification if behavior changes; never mix feature work with repo-health cleanup; never touch the high-risk class without explicit instruction. A structural change (many files or redrawn boundaries) is not one `improve`: run `plan`, then execute it as an ordered sequence of contained, verified `improve` steps.
